# DP-WebApp

This is supposed to be setup in a Python virtual environment, so you can do that by

typing "python -m venv ." when you are inside this directory. And then do "source Scripts/activate" if in bash,
or ".\Scripts\Activate.ps1" if in Powershell.

And then to get the dependencies, you should be able to just do "pip install -r requirements.txt"

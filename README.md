# DP-WebApp

* This is supposed to be setup in a Python virtual environment, so you can do that by:

  * Typing "python -m venv ." when you are inside this directory. 
  * And then do "source Scripts/activate" if in bash, or ".\Scripts\activate" if in Powershell. 
  * And then to get the dependencies, you should be able to just do "pip install -r requirements.txt"


To deactivate the virtual environemnt, type "deactivate" in the command line.
